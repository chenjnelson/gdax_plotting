Plot candlestick and technical indicators from GDAX's API

This code was something I made in 2017 where I was exploring candlestick patterns and technical analysis for cryptocurrency trading purposes. I don't actively use these anymore, but I figured that I would provide this in case someone wants to explore how to navigate the TA-Lib and GDAX API in Python. Note that the code to visualize is sloppy, but can still provide some useful static information overall.

I have three versions to graph BTC-USD in the code, either to analyze candlestick patterns, trends, volume/price indicators, and more. Feel free to poke or modify as necessary.
